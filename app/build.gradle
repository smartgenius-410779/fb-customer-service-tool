    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.madhub.fbcustomerservicetoo" // Unique application ID that identifies the app in the Play Store.
        minSdkVersion 21 // Technical approach: Setting a minimum SDK version that supports modern features while ensuring a broad user base.
        targetSdkVersion 31 // Targeting the latest SDK version for best compatibility with newer Android features.
        versionCode 1 // Versioning practice: Increment this for each release to ensure users get updates.

    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0' // Material design components for a modern user interface experience.

    // The below dependency is vital for integrating social media management features
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0' // Technical architecture: Retrofit for handling API calls, crucial for connecting to MadHub's automation services.

    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0' // Gson converter for JSON parsing, ensuring smooth data handling.

    // Dependency for scheduling tasks efficiently in the background.
    implementation 'androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.7.1' // Best practice: Use WorkManager for background tasks, which is important for ensuring reliability in operations like scheduling posts or managing customer interactions.

### Explanation of Build Configuration:
- **Project Structure**: The build.gradle files are structured hierarchically, with the top-level file configuring repositories and plugins and the module-level file handling specific application settings.
- **Dependencies**: Carefully chosen to support the application's core functionalities, from UI components to background processing, ensuring compliance with best practices for Android development.
- **Versioning**: Clear versioning practices implemented for both the app and the SDK target to maintain a smooth upgrade path and compatibility.
- **Resource Management**: English language resource configuration to optimize the build for specific market needs.

This build configuration provides a solid foundation for developing the fb customer service tool within the MadHub framework, promoting efficient use of Android's capabilities for social media automation.
